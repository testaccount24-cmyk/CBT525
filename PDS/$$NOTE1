Sam,

      (This is in reference to CFMONFX2.)

      Yes it should be applied with all the rest.   It is a
bypass fix in that it PREVENTs an S0C9 by setting the program
mask bit to ignore when an overflow occurs.  Not the most
accurate method but the numbers affected are only the totals.
Any aggregate or total numbers below 2Gig is OK.  My main
objective is to prevent the tool from ABENDing and terminating.
Another way to prevent the accumulator problem is to have CFMON
recycled every few days or so.  This resets the accumulators for
each structure bucket, thereby avoiding the abend conditions as
well.  On systems with low CF structure activity you may never
see an abend.  Our database product is a BIG user of structures.


Thanks!
Steve
