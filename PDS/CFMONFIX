Sam,

     Here is a contribution that might help some folks using the
freeware IBM utility CFMON (coupling facility monitor).  The CFMON
utility is an "AS IS" utility from IBM, they have RMF level check
to not work on 2.6 or higher.  This zap will bypass the error
logic. I also NOP'd the ESTAE for debugging purposes, it is not
needed to enable the bypass.   It even works on 64bit mode
machines!

Regards,
Stephen
